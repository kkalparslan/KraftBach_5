 There are 4 access modifier in JAVA.
    - public
    - default
    - protected
    - private
    * Variable- Constructor- Methods
    ** public **
    The access level is everywhere. What does everywhere mean?
    - current class- outside the current class within package- outside package

    ** default **
    The access level is only within same package.
    If there is no access modifier it will be default.

    ** protected **
    If there is no relationship between classes, protected access modifieer is like default.
    But if there is a Parent-child relation between classes, the child class can reach parent class
    even if it is outside the package (for data member ond methods)

    ** private **
    The access level is only within the class.
    It can not reach from outside the class.
    ** Private constructor role **
    you cant create an instance out of the class.

    **method overloading**
    Modifiers in the child class cannot be more restrictive

    ** local variable**
    dont have access modifier.
